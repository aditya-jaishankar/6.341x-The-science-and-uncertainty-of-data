## Lecture 1: Probability models and axioms

* The basic concept in probability is that of a *sample space*.

* Probability laws help calculate probabilities of a particular event in the sample space from occuring. These laws have to respect axioms - for example, probabilities cannot be negative; the axioms are few, but powerful.


The following equation <img src="/tex/b1185cf9f05b29c99b55c0cde01294f5.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=39.96184334999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> can also be explanded as:

Does references to equation labels work? How about we try this out - this is Equatios. So equation labels don't work unfortunately. How about <img src="/tex/3d4151a3d8a38cbf914241940cd04493.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=53.68411289999999pt height=27.91243950000002pt/>.
