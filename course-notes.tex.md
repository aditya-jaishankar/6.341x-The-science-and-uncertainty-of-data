## Lecture 1: Probability models and axioms

* The basic concept in probability is that of a *sample space*.

* Probability laws help calculate probabilities of a particular event in the sample space from occuring. These laws have to respect axioms - for example, probabilities cannot be negative; the axioms are few, but powerful.
- There are three chief requirements for a sample space $\Omega$: (1) That the elements of the set are mutually exclusive i.e. only any one event can occur simultaneously at a time, (2) The elements of the set need to be collectively exhaustive i.e. the set captures all possible outcomes and (3) must be at the right granularity i.e.  the probability model must be able to leave out unnecessary details, for example whether it is taining outside. (1) and (2) together means that one and only one outcome in the sample space *must* occur.
