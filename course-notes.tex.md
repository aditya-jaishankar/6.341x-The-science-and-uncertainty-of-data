## Lecture 1: Probability models and axioms

* The basic concept in probability is that of a *sample space*.

* Probability laws help calculate probabilities of a particular event in the sample space from occuring. These laws have to respect axioms - for example, probabilities cannot be negative; the axioms are few, but powerful.


The following equation $x=y$ can also be explanded as:

\begin{align}
  \dfrac{a}{b} = {c}{d} \label{eq1}
\end{align}

Does references to equation labels work? How about we try this out - this is Equation $~\ref{eq1}$.
